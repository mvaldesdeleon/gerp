# gerp

Expressive grpc server, with plugabble encoding.

Scope is limited to exactly my use case.

# Why

gRPC is great, but maybe you don't want to go all-in with protobuf.
In that case, you'll find yourself out of luck with the commonly-suggested libraries.

The official library is straight-forward enough, but we can provide a better API for it, more in tune to what developers would expect.

I wish `mali` exposed this level of configuration, then I would not need to write this.
